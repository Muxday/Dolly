## Devlog (in Dewan Mukto's perspective)
```
✔️ 20 May 2022 : Development started. Fierce programming in progress. Managed to create buttons using DiscordJS v13.
✔️ 21 May 2022 : Began implementing music commands. Was programming for more than 10 hours. Result not complete yet.
✔️ 22 May 2022 : Success! Music features are now available. But I still gotta find a way to reduce latency to improve the bitrate.
✔️ 23 May 2022 : Decided to switch to a different bot for all of MuxDay's music features. Designed new logos using Canva.
✔️ 24 May 2022 : Set up a new website for MuxMusic. Spent majority of today's time working on that.
✔️ 26 May 2022 : New feature for MuxDay that auto-deletes any messages containing unknown links.
✔️ 27 May 2022 : New meme/image fetching features for MuxDay.
✔️ 28 May 2022 : New virtual currency system and economy! DayCoins and NyteCoins. Balance, Create, Transfer and Steal!
✔️ 29 May 2022 : Added a shop. Buy tools, weapons, protection equipment. Crimes increase wanted levels gradually. JSONs JSONs everywhere!
✔️ 30 May 2022 : Today marks the 10th day of progress. Added gacha rolls (cards) and a card showcasing system. Need to add a feature to sell duplicates.
✔️ 31 May 2022 : Worked on the job feature. Managed to get the job board right, and also the daily reward system.
✔️ 01 June 2022 : Worked on 'work' function. Currently just provides money instantly. Will add puzzling tasks to make it more fun and challenging, later.
🔥 02 June 2022 : Worked on 'fish','sell', and 'inventory'. Something's wrong with 'sell' and 'fish'. Had to shut down my bots for diverting attention towards finding jobs.
